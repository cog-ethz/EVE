# Welcome to the EVE Framework

The release of version 1.3.2 updates EVE to run on the curren Long-Term Support version of Unity (as of April 2020). We also removed some deprecated code and we cleaned up some code. The menu has been overhauled a bit and lets you glimpse and exciting features for data analysis to come with the next major update!

## Tutorials

We will provide you with a series of tutorials to get acquainted with all aspects of EVE. For now, there is only one tutorial showing you the basics.

## Q&A

We have set up a [Q&A site for EVE](https://eve.qhub.com/) where you can ask questions about anything EVE related. Whether you want to know if a certaine experiment could be run with EVE or you have questions about a particular feature of EVE, we are there to help you. If you would like to suggest a new feature, you can create an [issue on our github repository](https://github.com/cog-ethz/EVE/issues).
